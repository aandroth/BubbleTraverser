Current goal: Get the CI/CD working
This is actually pretty close. I just need the CodeBuild finished, and that just seems to need the npm installed.

Having a a hard time with a file still pointing to some main.js that still looks for localhost...
I've deleted the file from the git push to see if that helps
	Deleting the index.html in the root does cause the site to go down
Site still pointing to localhost...
Scripts in the S3 seem to be correct
Deleted cdk and vs folders, no effect
Blue border is present, but local and site don't show this...
Site still isn't updated. Could this be a cache issue?
Site files are up to date. Need to invalidate cache...
Tried from an incognito window and this works.
	So weird since it just doesn't update the content from main.js, but does update index.html...
The more windows I add the slower things get, and it seems like the redraw just gets overwhelmed with new messages, drawing all of them in order, instead of just taking the latest
I have changed the code so that in the update it ignores update calls until it finishes its redraw.
	This may make it super choppy
